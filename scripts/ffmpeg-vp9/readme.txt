Usefully for encoding videos that you want to be embeddable, like in Discord.

Modify the the "crf" flag between 0â€“63 to change the constrained quality.
Modify the "deadline" flag between good and best to change speed of encode.
modify the "cpu-used" flag between 0-5 on good-best and 0-8 on realtime to change the efficiency of the encode.

The changes needs to be applied to both "params-pass1.txt" and "params-pass2.txt" with the exception of  the "pass" flag
